# Tetris
 My goal was to create tetris game all by myself, without other's algorithm.

# Description
 My application, simply runs tetris game, generates default tetris figures and gives you ability to play tetris. it's tetris... you played tetris before, right?
 I used only pygame, but not all the functionality, only lines and rectangles draw, because i wanted to create whole game all by myself, as i said before.

# Getting started
 If you want to run my game at your device for some reasons, you just need to clone my py file named "main" and run it.
 
# Using
 It randomly generates figures at start, you can move it left, right and down, if you want to rotate press up button, but you already know that, i am just explaining tetris to you.
